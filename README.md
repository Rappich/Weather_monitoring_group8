# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## **1. Introduction**

### **1.1 Purpose**
This document defines the requirements for a real-time weather monitoring system. The system simulates weather monitoring using C++ threads and periodic tasks to collect, process, and display data from temperature, humidity, and wind speed sensors.

### **1.2 Scope**
The system will operate in a real-time environment, generating simulated sensor data, processing it to calculate statistics, and displaying the results in the console. It is intended for educational purposes and will demonstrate real-time programming concepts.

## **2. System Overview**

### **2.1 Features**
- **Sensor Simulation**: Simulates three sensors (temperature, humidity, wind speed) using threads.
- **Data Collection**: Shared memory is used to store sensor data, with mutexes for thread safety.
- **Data Processing**: Calculates mean, min, and max values for each sensor every 5 seconds.
- **Data Display**: Displays real-time data updates every 2 seconds and statistics every 10 seconds.

### **2.2 Constraints**
- Implemented in C++ with threads and mutexes.
- Timing intervals for data generation, processing, and display must be strictly followed.

## **3. Functional Requirements**

### **3.1 Sensor Simulation**
- Each sensor must:
  - Generate random data every 500 ms.
  - Operate within these ranges:
    - Temperature: -30째C to 40째C
    - Humidity: 0% to 100%
    - Wind Speed: 0 m/s to 30 m/s.

### **3.2 Data Collection**
- Use shared memory to store the latest readings from all sensors.
- Protect shared memory with a mutex to ensure thread-safe access.
- Signal when new data is available using flags.

### **3.3 Data Processing**
- Calculate statistics (mean, min, max) every 5 seconds using the last 10 readings from each sensor.

### **3.4 Data Display**
- Display the latest sensor data in the console every 2 seconds.
- Display calculated statistics every 10 seconds.

---

## **4. Non-Functional Requirements**
- **Reliability**: Tasks must meet real-time constraints without race conditions or delays.
- **Maintainability**: The system should be modular and easy to extend with new sensors.
- **Usability**: Console output must be clear and formatted for readability.
