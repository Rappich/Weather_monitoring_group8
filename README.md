## Software Requirements Specification

### 1.3 Intended Use
**Purpose**:  
The program serves as a console interface for an alarm operator.

**Exclusions**:  
The program does not include advanced graphical interfaces or physical hardware interactions.

### 2.1 User Needs
The application addresses the following user needs:
- The user should be able to register the customer's name and/or company name.

### 3.1 Functional Requirements
The program supports the following functionalities:
- Assigning a unique ID to each user.
- Providing users with a numeric code for alarm activation/deactivation.
- Issuing a tag ID for the RFID sensor.
- Verifying false alarms during the alarm testing phase.
- Registering and managing alarm components, including:
  - Component type
  - Component name
  - Unique component ID
- Supporting a shutdown phrase to turn off alarms.

### 3.4 Nonfunctional Requirements
- **Security**: Ensure secure storage and handling of user codes and data.
- **Performance**: The program should run efficiently on standard systems and handle multiple alarms effectively.
